# HTML Tag Format Checker

Checks that each starting tag has an ending tag, and that there are no extra ending/starting tags. This ignores the validity of the tags, and instead just checks the format. 
It will accept any tag value, whether or not it is actually a valid HTML tag. To make this program more useful, additional functionality would be to 
check that the given tag value is actually a valid HTML tag.

Uses Node.js to run, and Jest for Unit Tests.
